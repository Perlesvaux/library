ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I am indebted to Sally Soriano, Peggy Noton, Jane Scantlebury, and Richard Plevin for their valuable support and helpful criticisms of the manuscript. On numerous occasions, Jane also utilized her professional librarian skills to track down much needed information at my request. My thanks also to Stephanie Welch, Neala Hazé, and Kathryn Cahill for valuable assistance rendered.
Again, I wish to express my gratitude to Nancy J. Peters, my editor at City Lights Books, for her encouragement and her critical reading of the final text. And belated thanks are owed my publisher, the poet and artist Lawrence Ferlinghetti, for inviting me to become a City Lights author some years ago. Finally, a word of appreciation to Stacey Lewis and others too numerous to mention who partook in the production and distribution of this book: they who do the work.

To the Reds and others, nameless heroes. Many, who resisted yesterday's Blackshirts and who continue to fight today's ruthless corporate stuffed shirts. And to the memory of Sean Gervasi and Max Gundy, valued friends and warriors for social justice.
Per chi conosce solo il tuo colore, bandiera rossa, tu devi realmente esistere, perchè lui esista ... tu che già vanti tante glorie borghesi e operaie, ridiventa straccio, e il più povero ti sventoli. For him who knows only your color, red flag, you must really exist, so he may e x i s t . . . you who already have achieved many bourgeois and working-class glories, you become a rag again and the poorest wave you. — Pier Paolo Pasolini
